##### Summary: Measuring %reads allocated to ribosomes/catabolic resources

1. Define 'ribosome' and catabolic resources:
    * Catabolic: all genes activated by Crp
    * Ribosomes: find list of all E.coli ribosomal subunits, search through KEGG database for 'ribosomal subunit'

2. Have lists of gene names (hopefully from E.coli MG1655 for both, now trying to covert them into bnums using keggAPI
