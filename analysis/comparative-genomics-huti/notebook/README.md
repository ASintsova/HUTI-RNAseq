##### Summary: Starting to put together virulence factor table

* Starting with fimbria
* For initial visualization going to start with ones found in CFT073 - and that's a lot!
* Gotta get all the locus tags in place

* Doing all of this manually right now

* Clustering is not working right now, not sure why.

##### Summary: Created presence/absence of fimbria map, but it is wrong

* Progress, however missing some genes, might be problem with annotation. Need to explore

* Minor editing details as well
