## Models of Evolution of Continous Characters:

### Brownian Motion:

* Random Walk
* Trait value can be modelled by normal distribution: N(W(0), sigma^2*t), where W(0) - starting value of character and variance increases with time.
* Describes motion under the influence of large number of small independent weak forces, adding many small independent variables results in normal distribution (Central Limit Theorem) - means of large number of samples will follow nrmal distribution
* Selection is weak, or changes through time, genetic drift, random punctuated change
* To simulate draw numbers from Normal distribution
* Look at what is: variance-co-variance matrix, Revell et al 2008

#### Independent Contrasts:

* Way to analyze data that comes from phylogenetics trees
* Test for evolutionary correlation between characters
* Think of as statistical transformation
* Tells us something about rate of evolution
* Evaluate if 2 traits are evoving in correlated fashion
* Calculate independent contrast for 2 characters, carry out regression analysis (with no intercept)
