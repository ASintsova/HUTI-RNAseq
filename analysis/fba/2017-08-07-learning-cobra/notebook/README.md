* Going though [matlab tutorial](http://bio5495.wustl.edu/SystemsBiology/Literature/Orth-2010-supplement.pdf) for FBA with help of python [COBRApy](https://cobrapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/simulating.html#Changing-the-Objectives)
* Jupyter notebook (What_is_flux_balance_analysis?) saved in `/lib`

##### Summary: Starting to look for packages to incorporate gene expression into the model

* 2 packages: CORDA and CobraME (from palsson lab). Neither is well tested or straight forward to use.
* Starting with CORDA because it is simpler
