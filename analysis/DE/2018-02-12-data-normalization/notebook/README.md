##### Summary: Putting together `saturation_curves.py`

* Wrote function to subsample without replacement
* Calculate coverage on the the subsampled file
* Count how many genes are at or above certain coverage (or # of reads)

##### Summary: Testing and running `saturation_curves.py`

* Running for HM01 in UR and in UTI, looking at genes that have 10 or more reads at 0.1, 1, 10, 50 and 75%
* Running 5 iterations, seems to be pretty consistent


#### 2018-02-19
##### Summary: want to include 25% as well

* Running subsampling, but it's very slow. eh. 
* Want another point (25 % to see what that looks like)
