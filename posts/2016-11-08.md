# Daily Summary

- Thawed UCUM3 cells
- Did RNA-preps from cell culture samples: 
  * 1-3: CFT inside UCUM3
  * 4-5: Deut inside UCUM3
  * 6-8: CFT outside
  * 9-12: Deut outside
  * 13-15: Unifected cells
- Cleaned up bench and poured plates
- Started o/n for growth curve tomorrow
- For cytotox assay:
  * Want to do time course:
     - plate in 24 well plates, as always: 2 wells uninfected, 2 wells infected with CFT as usual (1 hr, 100 ug/ml gent 1 hour, 10 ug/ml
     gent), 2 wells same but no 10 ug/ml gent, 2 wells add bacteria to cells, 2 wells add bacteria with no cells just DMEM.
     - take sup aliquots at 6 hr, 24 hr, and 48 hours
     - DMEM alone as a blank to remove background
     - assay: basically 50 ul of sup + 50 ul of substrate, incubate 10 min, stop, read fluorescence excitation 560, emission 590)
     - reader in commone equipment room, black plates with clear bottoms. 
  * Ideally will be able to set up 8 wells of cells tomorrow
