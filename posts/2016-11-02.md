# Daily Summary:
- Looked at arabinose gene expression for Chris and Val, used this as a case study to put together pipeline for any
gene list analysis: about 50% done, need to finish the markdown
- Having issues with id2eg function from pathview package: had to recompile the package twice to make it work :S
- Threw together slides for Clinical UTI meeting:
  * Not the most polished slides, but overall meeting went well, general conclusions:
    - Continue with pathway analysis, read the literature to figure out which metabolism pathways are worth focusing on
    - Ali will continue with analysis of non-core genome, non-coding RNAs, etc.
    - Showed Evan my first clustering attempts/evolution of gene experession stuff, he suggested we set up a regular meeting
    to crystalize these ideas
    - Good progress overall
- Set up for sac for tomorrow: going to be a crazy busy days, so poured plates, lableled tubes/plates, etc.
