# Daily Summary:

- Read about RNAseq data normalization (see notes on Evernote)
- Started bacterial cultures for tomorrows mouse experiment as well as Imperiale experiment
- Met with Ali with regards TIIS etc
  * did not come to any specific concesus: it appears I'm using the right formula. Ali is skeptical about my gene selection,
  I'm quite confident in that aspect. Overall, we agree that RPKM is not the way to go. Going to replace NAs with 0, and use DESeq
  to see if that makes a difference. 
  * shelving TIIS for now
  - Continuing with organizing things on flux and Google Drive
