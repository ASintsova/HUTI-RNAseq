# Daily Summary:

- Mouse sac, Sara saced, diluted and plated urines, I homogenized and plated bladders
- Plated -2, -1, and 0 dilutions with spiral plater
- Meeting with Evan: set up goals for evolution of gene expression analysis project. Good brainstorm. 
  Bottom line: need to read/find tools that look for phylogenetic signal in gene expression, perform this 
  for UR and UTI populations, see for which genes (groups of genes) this signal changes based on condition
- Met with Dr. Bokaletz. Interesting research.
