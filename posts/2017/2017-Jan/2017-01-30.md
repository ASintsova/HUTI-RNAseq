	* Split cells
	* Set up one plate for experiment for tomorrow
	* Start bacterial cultures for experiment for tomorrow
	* Experiment will be repetition of the one last week

* Finish with GFF files and re-run the analysis 

	* NOTE TO SELF: stop randomly deleting things!!!!!!!
	* Got newer version of PROKKA HM43 gff - no problem running the python script
	* Re-running HTseq count

* Working on imporving pathway analysis:


	* it looks like for E.coli tools often use 'b numbers' as identifiers
	* going to need to convert my PROKKA IDs to b numbers
	* found a webstit where can download description and lots of other info including correlation between b numbers and gene symbols, uniprot ids, etc

		* [ecogene db](http://ecogene.org/?q=ecodownload/dbtable)
	
	* Spent most of the day working on the script to get b numbers 75% there. Got confused with PROKKA_IDs: forgot that they are not the same from genome to genome. FML
	* Stats
	* Finish BIA assignment

## To do by Wednesday:		
* Compare gene lists to Ali's 
* Finally do some reading (all those papers Evan sent you)
