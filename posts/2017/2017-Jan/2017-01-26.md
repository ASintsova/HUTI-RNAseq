# Daily Summary:

## Plan:

* Journal roundup (10:30)
* Lyse 48 and plate 48 h timepoint(11:30)
* Count plates from yesterday(11:45)
	* counts do not make sense: Deut has not defect, but Deut + R and DeutR + R do. Going to repeat one more time next week and then give up.
* Read OD curve for 48 h tp(12:00)
	* Looks good, going to do one more reading tomorrow
	
* Re-do gff files(6:00)

	* Idea: cross-reference your gh-gff with prokka-gff, using prokka id and make sure contig # (and location) is correct
	* Success, files re-done, will need to rerun the rest of analysis tomorrow
	
* Seminar at noon(1:00)
	* chikungunya virus emergence and control through vaccination: kinda boring
	
* Snitkin lab meeting(5:00)
* Finish Week 4 BIA(7:00)
* Read Stats ch 2(7:30)
