# Daily Summary:
- Lab meeting presentation:
  * overall went well, experiments to consider: complement eutR mutant with pGen eutR
  * do neutrophils affect EA availability: eutR expression in urine with or without neutrophil depletion
  
- Sara is busy could only schedule mouse experiments for March
- Exocytosis samples: looked weird: bacteria didn't appear to grow very well, most wells looked uninfected. Not consistent
between replicates. Giving up on everything except for CFT and Deut infections: pretty sure killed those cells before 
infection began. Did -8 dilution.
