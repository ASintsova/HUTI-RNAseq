# Daily Summary:

* Split cells (initially planned to ran an experiment on Thursday, but had to cancel since workshop and JC prep took too long)
* Read paper for JC (ended up being way too complicated, never pick cell paper again)
* BIA
* Stats (learing pandas: merging dataframes, so that can merge counts from RNAseq data) -- success!!
* RNAseq counts ready to be analysed, and RPKM ready to be calculated!!
