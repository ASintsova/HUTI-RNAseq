# Daily Summary:

## Clustering PCA analysis on:

* Core genes (Media, PHYLO)
* UR (PHYLO)
* UTI(PHYLO)

	* Conclusions - overall see preservation of phylogenetics signal, however this is largely obscured when comparing two growth conditions. 

	* All analysis was done using DESeq packages, maybe look at other clustering packages
	* HM54 and HM68 look staggeringly different from the rest: can we find explanation (i.e. are there any errors?)
	* Ask Ali for the same analysis to see if we come up with the same basic results? 
	* See how this compares to published results
	* Aks Ali to re-check phylogroup assignation
	* Can I do PCA/clustering on data with N/A values?
	* From here can go on to explore phylogenetic signal stuff

	* If have time will look at eQTL tutorials

	
## Pathway analysis:

* Wrote python script to extract gene names where possible
* Now see if I can convert gene names to ENSEMBLE # (or whatever that package needs - more details to follow	
	* Converted 359 out of 485 de genes 

* ran gage/pathview analysis using log2FC (not replicates and counts)
	* reassuringly results appear to be quite similar to those obtained with prior analysis 
	* want to do the same with replicates(counts or RPKM?)
	* start visualizing this

	
	
## Cell Culture:
* Set up cells for infection for tomorrow
* 1 24 well plate at 2*10^5/well
* started bacterial cultures of CFT, Deut, Deut+R, DeutR + R
