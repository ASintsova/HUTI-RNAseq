# Daily Summary:
- Changed plans a little: since don't need plates till next week, not going to pour them today
- Spent morning brainstroming core-genome paper:
  * key issues: too many transcriptomics papers need to come up with a different sping on the data
  * bring in gene expression differences based on things other than UR vs. UTI, such as history, phylogroup, strain, etc
  * bring in the whole QTL thing
  * probably will need something about rRNAs
  * growth rate?
