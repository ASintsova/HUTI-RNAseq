# Daily Summary:
- Infect UCUM3 cells.
  - Cells look good.
  - 3x +/- EA, 48 h for intracellular, 24 h for exocytosis
  - Make 45 ml of DMEM with EA/B12:
    * stock EA: 5.6 M, final [] 5 mM
    * stock B12: 0.5 mM, final [] 150 nm
    * add 40 ul of EA and 13.5 ul of B12 to 45 ml of DMEME
    
  - MOI 25. Infect with CFT073, Deut, eutR, Deut+eutR(DR)
    * cft (4ml)(25*4*10^5/0.5) = x(1.7e9) x = 47ul OD:0.34
    * Deut (4ml)(25*4*10^5/0.5) = x(1.85e9) x = 43ul OD:0.37
    * cft (4ml)(25*4*10^5/0.5) = x(1.8e9) x = 44ul OD:0.36
    * cft (4ml)(25*4*10^5/0.5) = x(1.6e9) x = 50ul OD:0.31
    
   - Check that all cells look good:
    * they do not: cft/Deut look ok, R and DR not so hot: I think I left them
    without media for too long!!!!!
    - Spin 500 rpm 5 min no break
    - Leave at 37oC for 1 h (a little longer, I was hoping cell will recover, they did not)
    - Wash 1x
    - add 100 ug/ml gent (with or without EA)
    - @ 37 for 1 h
    - Wash 2x
    - add either 10 ug/ml gent and leave for 48 h or 100 mM alph methyl blabla and leave for 24 h
    
- Prep lab meeting
- Read a little about stats
- Start lit search for Thursday, and be on a lookout for a paper for next week
