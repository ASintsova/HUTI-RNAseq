# Daily Summary:

## Plan:
* Quick look at phylogenetic signal pakcages
* Look through transcriptome paper

	* Figures: phylogenetic tree, PCA analysis, which virulence factors are expressed, heat map of non-coding RNAs
	
* Lab Meeting
* Meeting with Beckah - how do you spell that?
* Lyse 24 h cell point + do a reading for culture growing in EA

	* this looks good: looks like eutR complemented the eutR mutants but not the deletion mutant
	
* Put together notes for meeting with Evan


* Read Stats: didn't happene
* Worked some more with RPKMs: bottom line going to leave this alone for time being and focus on core gene expression analysis


## Meeting with Evan:

* my gff files are wrong :( 
* need to brainstorm and remake!
	 * consequently will have to redo all the core analysis 
	 * also will need to compare to PROKKA gffs to see if similar, i.e. if same genes are mapped to same locations
* new link to yet another RNAseq pipeline tool
