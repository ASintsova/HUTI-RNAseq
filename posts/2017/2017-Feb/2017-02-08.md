# Daily Summary:

* Had to deal with a disaster that is my house, so got a late start today
* Had a code review: brief and focused again on organization of all your data

	* Have to do some minor restructuring once again
	* also figure out better ways to use flux mentioned in the meeting

* Tried to have Ali explain things to me, but he escaped, will attempt again tomorrow


* Today will work on putting everything together into one structure: want to re-run HTseq using PROKKA# instead of gene_ids

* Hopefully tomorrow I will learn how to merge them together + how to get proper IDs for all of them
