# Daily Summmary:

* Mouse experiment week:

	* Today need to start culutres and pour plates

* Sequencing completed on Proteus samples:

	* Have the sequences, ask for 3 weeks to get them analyzed
	* Don't forget to download the sequences
	



**Next Week:**

* Reproducible research workshop
* Proteus RNAseq - in the process document your RNAseq pipeline, put together report with QC and data in good digestable form 

* Note to self: Need to reschedule experiment in early March: schdueled infection for when I'm out of town


* UTI RNAseq plan:

	* Look at 2-3 other conserved pathways besides ribosomes: would be better if I had the gene identifiers, but probably can work with what I have so far. See if the trend the same as for ribosomes. 
	* Look for genes whose expression is correlated/anti-correlated with ribosome gene expression

	
	_Ribosome Summary:_
	
	* In general ribosome gene expression significantly upregulated in UTI
	* In urine, B1 strains cluster together and show about 2x lower ribo gene expression compared to that of B2 strains -> two possible explanations: grow slower in urine compared to B2, alternatively they grow faster and have reached stat phase earlier than B2 (as suggested by higher levels of sra expression)
	* In uti phylogenetic clustering breaks down suggesting that host factors trump strain genetics 
	
	* Proportions of ribosome components did not change

	*Still to do*:
	
	* Identify genes of interest
	* Find locations of each on the genome


**Today:**:

* Worked through ~90 of GAGE documentation and improved pathway analysis, even though I still don't have proper identifiers

	* 3 things significantly up: ribosome, purine, and pyrimidine metabolism - growing and actively dividing!

	* ~ 16 or 17 downregulated pathways, has more to do with metabolism
	* Also about 8 pathways distrubed both up and down, also interesting to look at
	* To continue: look at the genes involved specifically, draw up a couple of heatmaps, see what it looks like
