# Daily Summary:

* Journal draft
* Lyse and plate 48 h tp, count plates from yesterday, read OD for 48 hr tp for EA grown cultures

	* As expected complete failure to reporduce previous results + I do think there's a bit of an artifact with things on right side of the plate surviving worse than those on the left side of the plate :S
	
* Go through files uploaded by Ali - nevermind, it was all PTR

	* QC
	* Co-expression clusters
	
* Eric Martens seminar at noon
* Snitkin lab meeting
* Finish BIA1
* Stats


### Projects Summary:
* Pathway analysis: on hold, waiting for Ali:
	* gene_ids
	* log2FC changes for core genome
	* Do some basic QC on read counts to make sure nothing is funky, especially with HM68

* Co-expression analysis:
	* Need to do some reading on methods, try a couple of different packages/ways to do this

* eQTL:
	* Hoping this will be guided by co-expression analysis results
