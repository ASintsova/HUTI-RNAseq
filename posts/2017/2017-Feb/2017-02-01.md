# Daily Summary

* Re-running the analysis of the count data:

	* Have some concerns about the counts, see few differences from previous counts attempt, although the annotation for those genes did not change, need to do some more QC
	* But PCA and clustering analysis looks very good! 
	* gene list I have from Ali cannot be the right one - some concerning differences, but need to get right list from him before can draw any conclusions
	
* Post-doc interview

* Clinical UTI Meeting:
	
	* to get specific gene identifiers: Alis is going to blast against kegg and it'll give you definitively what genes they are -> consequently going to abandon my poor attempts at matching b numbers with my gene ids. 

	* SNPs variant calling pipeline by Ali

	* Bring back Sarguru's strains and see where they fit in
	* Get new gene list from Ali with log2FC to compare

* Lyse 24 h timepoint, plate -1 dilution, and take a reading for strains growing in EA
