# Daily Summary:

  * Organizing myself for this week
    - this week going to restart cell culture with UCUM3
      - repeat of 48 hr tp
      - repeat of exocytosis
      - cytotoxicity assays
    - testing cells for Imperiale lab on Friday
    - giving journal club on Friday, so need to read the paper! 
    
  * Reading about gene expression evolution
  
      - Plan of attack:
        - lack a lot of theoretical knowledge (stats!!!) - this will have to come slowly, don't get frustrated
        - lack of literature knowledge, try to slowly read up slowly but thoroughly
        1. look through 3 R packages you/Evan found: TreeExp1.0, phylosignal, phytools: try to apply to your list of homologues
        2. if looks promising, take a step back look at get homologues, come up with better list of those
        Looking for: genes with phylo signal in UR, genes with phylo signal in UTI - overlap between the two, genes who's fold change
        UTI/UR has phylo signal (evolution of host response)- is that right?
        
  * Presenting lab meeting in Evan's lab
  ## Approximate plan for the week:  
  - Monday: Read/plan/present
  - Tuesday: Thaw cells, do RNA preps from cell culture pellets (if you can find them!). Plan out cytotoxicity assays. Look into those R
  packages
  - Wednesday: OD curves for DeutR, ReutR, ideally in both LB and minimal media, and urine. Have something to show Evan. 
    * if have time and RNA isolation successful: qPCR for eutR expression. If cells are ready, set up a plate for cytotoxicity assays
  - Thursday: Infect for cytotoxicity - ideally 2, 6, 24, 48 - make sure you plan out your controls well 
    * Don't forget meeting with Evan (3 pm)
  - Journal club, Imperiale infection
