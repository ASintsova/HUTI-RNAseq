# Day Summary:
- CIHR completed and submitted, best of luck to me
- Went through pathway analysis again (Pathview and Gage): not overly useful, as in nothing is significantly different but 
this is probably due to the fact that there are not that many genes in the list. On Wedneday make a table to top 10 up, down and 
what are the genes found in each
- Began co-clustering analysis: again nothing too useful at this point, max # of strains in the cluster ~7, Urine samples always  
cluster together, and so do UTIs, similarly need to start expanding to larger number of genes? Look at a different clustering 
package. Overall, not bad progress
- Started o/n for mouse experiment tomorrow. Went back to Sarguru's stocks for CFT073, and Deut. Also started DpGen and DeutR. Have 
30 mice not sure what the best way to divide the groups are. 8,8, 7,7,?
