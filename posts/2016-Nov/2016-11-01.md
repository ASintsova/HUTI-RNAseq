# Daily Summary:
- Prepared inoculums for mouse infection:
  * CFT and Deut (Sarguru's trains): 8 mice per group
  * Deut + pGen (DE) and Deut + pGenEutR (DR): 7 mice per group
    - Grew o/n in 50 ml tubes (45 ml of LB + from frozen cultures)
    - Spin, resuspend in 5 ml PBS
    - Measure OD of 1/10 dilution:
      * C: 0.59, make 5 ml at 0.4: 3.4 ml of bacteria + 1.6 PBS
      * D: 0.54, 3.7 + 1.3
      * DE: 0.57, 3.5 + 1.5
      * DR: 0.52, 3.8 + 1.2
      
- Put together a few slide for meeting for tomorrow:
  - Pathway analysis with top upregulated/ downregulated genes
    * what is next?
  - Clustering strains based on expression patterns of core genes + compare to phylogeny
  
- Look at arabinose gene expression in vivo for Chris
  * Use this as an opportunity to organize all the appropriate files in one place
