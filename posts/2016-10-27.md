# Plan for the day:
- CIHR:
  - finalize and upload proposal and training expectations, get signature pages done
    * proposal and signature pages done, waiting on Scott
- Go through gene list genereated by Ali:
  - pathway analysis
    * Learned Pathview, had success converting gene symbols to KEGG
    * [Vignette](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/pathview/inst/doc/pathview.pdf) 
  - biggest changes: up/down
  
- Re-think how to merge RPKM tables/ gene-rownames
  - new strategy: `make.names(names, unique = TRUE)`
  - What are other strategies to do co-expression analysis?
  - Ask Ali for raw/RPKM for every strain?
  
- Enter cell culture and mouse exeperiment data 
  - do not be upset
