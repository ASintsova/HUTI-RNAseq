# Plan for the day:
- CIHR:
  - finalize and upload proposal and training expectations, get signature pages done
  
- Go through gene list genereated by Ali:
  - pathway analysis
  - biggest changes: up/down
  
- Re-think how to merge RPKM tables/ gene-rownames
  - What are other strategies to do co-expression analysis?
  - Ask Ali for raw/RPKM for every strain?
  
- Enter cell culture and mouse exeperiment data 
  - do not be upset
