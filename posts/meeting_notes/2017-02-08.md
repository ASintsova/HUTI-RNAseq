* Questions:

	* Do you run all the analysis on flux all the time? Can we talk about how to have access to flux data from Desktop again? **Yes**
	* Go over the annotation combination script 
	* I made a folder on nfs, also should we try to re-organize your RNAseq folder according to what we talked about? That way it'll be easier for me to see what you've done
	* how do you build a tree?
