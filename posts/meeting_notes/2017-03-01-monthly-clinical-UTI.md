# Meeting notes

* Update from Ali:

-  PTR:

  * 0.5x coverage is sufficient to correctly predict
  * average doubling time in human ~ 15 min
  * HM14 correlate ribosomal gene expression  
  * HM17
  * HM56
  * HM66
  * HM68



* General outline:

Fig 1: Description of our strains

 - Phylogenetic tree to show them in context of other strains
 - Show that in general the biggest difference in gene expression is between UR
 and UTI, but there's also a significant component due to strain genetic background-color


Fig 2: Common Transcriptome:

- Common regulatory pathways?
- What can we learn about environment?
- Is rapid growth beneficial, what could be the consequences?

- Current pathway analysis

Fig 3: Variable Transcriptome:

 - What variation can we attribute to host vs bacterial genetics growth rate vs
 ribosomal gene expression



- can we compare ribosomal gene expression to PTR
