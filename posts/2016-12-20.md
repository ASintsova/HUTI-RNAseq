eutH: H: 10 mice: 0.55 -> 3.6 + 1.4

* Pilot Imperiale expt:
  BKPyV + CFT073 co-infection in RPTE cells:
    - RPTE cells were seeded at 8e5/well in 12-well plate 24 h before the infection
    - pre-chill 12-well plate at 4oC for 15 min
    - Make virus and bacteria at 2x (MOI4 for virus, MOI200 for bacteria):
      - 1.5 ml (4e7) = x(1.8e9) -> add 33.3 ul to 1.5 ml of REBM media
      - mix with 1.5 of virus at MOI4
      - add 0.4 ml to each well of either virus + bacteria, or virus alone, or nothing
      - leave at 4oC for 1 h, rocking every 15 min
      - wash once with REBM media (0.5 ml)
      - add one ml of REBM + 10 ug/ml gentamicin
      - incubate at 37 oC for 1, 2, and 3 dpi
      - Michelle collects cells for western blots(?)
