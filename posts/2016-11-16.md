# Daily Summary:
- Counted plates from yesterday:
  * Cannot explain the results, need to ruminate
  * Also 1 h of 100 ug/ml gent doesn't kill all the bacteria: but potentially kills better with EA????
  * Test a couple of growth curves next week (not OD curves) 
  * Plated 24 h exo, with plater (-6 dilution)
  * Made figures 1,2,3 for EA (2 and 3 should really be one figure)
    * Log transformed CFU data to do stats(?)
  * Lab meeting and Vaccine meeting. 
  * Also: nothing grew on plates from contamination testing for Imperiale (yet another mystery)
