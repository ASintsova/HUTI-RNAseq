* `analysis` folder contains a folder for each of the figures:
    - [Figure 1](analysis/virulence_factor_expression)
    - [Figure 2 and Figure 3](analysis/in-patient-transcription-state)
    - [Figure 4](analysis/differential_expression_analysis)


* General settings for each of the jupyter notebooks can be found in [settings.py](analysis/methods/settings.py)
