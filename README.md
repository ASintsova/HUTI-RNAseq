# Characterization of UPEC-specific pan-transcriptiome in patients with uncomplicated UTIs

## Summary

----------


## Methods

### Sample Collection

* Bacterial strains:
    * UTI urine samples were streaked out on MacConkey. Identity and antibiotic profile were determined using VITEK2 system. 
    * Strains were cultured statically at 37oC to midexponential phase - thought to correspond to conditions in the bladder
* RNA samples: 
    * clean catch midstream urine samples were immediately stabilized with 2x volumes of RNAprotect.
    * Cell pellets, obtained from centrifugation of human UTI urine were stored at -80oC. Cell pellets wer treated with Proteinase K, total RNA extracted with RNeasy mini kit. Turbo DNase (Ambion).

### Sequencing
#### _RNA sequencing_

Bacterial RNA content was enhanced by selective depletion of human RNA using MICROBEEnrich kit (Ambion). Libraries were prepared using ScriptSeq Complete Kit:

  * removes ribosomal RNA 
  * creates stranded Illumina sequencing library
  * coding and non-coding RNA
  * claims that only 100ng is required
